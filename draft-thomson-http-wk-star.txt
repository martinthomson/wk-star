                The 'star' Well-Known Resource for HTTP
                   draft-thomson-http-wk-star-latest

Abstract

   The asterisk-form of request target for HTTP is rarely used.  This
   document defines a well-known resource that is equivalent to the
   asterisk-form target.

1.  Introduction

   HTTP defines the asterisk-form of a request target [HTTP].  This form
   is limited in applicability to just the OPTIONS method [RFC7231].

   Referring to a resource with the intent of using the asterisk-form is
   challenging.  Though the syntax of the http:// URI scheme permits the
   path to be absent, and the asterisk-form is defined for use with an
   empty path for the OPTIONS method, an empty path is equivalent to a
   path of "/" for all other methods.  Consequently, it is common for
   software to erroneously convert a request for a URI with an empty
   path to a request in origin-form and a path of "/", even for the
   OPTIONS method.

   This document defines a well-known resource [WELL-KNOWN] that is
   defined to be equivalent when used in origin- or absolute- form as a
   request with the asterisk-form.

   Defining a well-known resource allows the resource to be used more
   reliably.  It also provides a path for future versions of HTTP to
   remove support for the asterisk-form.

2.  The "star" Well-Known URI

   This document defines a well-known resource [WELL-KNOWN] with a URI
   suffix of "star".

   An OPTIONS request to /.well-known/star on any HTTP server is defined
   to be equivalent to an OPTIONS request that uses the asterisk-form.
   The semantics associated with other HTTP methods or other protocols
   is not defined.

   Thus, an OPTIONS request to "https://example.com/.well-known/star" is
   equivalent to an OPTIONS request to "https://example.com".

3.  Security Considerations

   As with any other well-known resource, the intent of this resource is
   to provide information that applies to the entire server.  As such,
   the security considerations of [RFC5785] apply.  Concerns about
   authority are mitigated by the inherent limitations of a resource
   that purports to speak for the entire server (see Section 4.3.7 of
   [RFC7231] for details).
